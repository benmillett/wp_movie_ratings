WP Movie Ratings changelog:

2006-06-27
- sidebar mode, where movie ratings are on a separate line, so the box can be as thin as 170px for star ratings (images) and 100px for text ratings.
- renamed HTTPRequest class to WP_HTTP_Request to avoid conflicts with other HTTPRequest classes from other plugins.
- new options panel which lets you set different display options (like the aforementioned sidebar mode).
- option to display movie ratings using just text as an alternative to the images with stars.
- fixed CSS problems with Internet Explorer (now works properly even with IE 5.0).
