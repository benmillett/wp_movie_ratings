- add error handling, when rating a movie without being logged in




Done
- sidebar mode, where movie ratings are on a separate line, so the box can be as thin as 170px for star ratings (images) and 100px for text ratings.
- renamed HTTPRequest to WP_HTTP_Request class to avoid conflicts with other HTTPRequest classes from other plugins

- release 1.0.1

2006-06-15
- release 1.0 (initial release)
