WP Movie Ratings v1.0.1 (2006-06-18)
====================================

WP Movie Ratings is a wordpress plugin that makes rating movies very easy. At
its core is a Firefox bookmarklet, which combined with Internet Movie Database
(imdb.com) and a little bit of AJAX magic lets you rate movies with just
1 click. Also, there is no need to write the title of the movie as it is
automatically fetched from imdb. Optionally, you can also write a short review
for each movie. The output from this plugin is a list of recently watched
movies, which you can put anywhere on your blog (it's a matter of one simple
function call from the template).

The published movie reviews are hReview (http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview)
compliant.

Requirements
----------------------------------

* Wordpress 2.0+
* PHP 5.0+
* FTP, SSH or SCP access to your wordpress blog (so you can upload this
  plugin).


Installation
----------------------------------

1. Download the plugin.

2. Extract the contents of the .tar.gz file into the Wordpress plugins
   directory (usually wp-content/plugins). Alternatively you can upload
   them using ftp. You should have a new directory there called
   wp_movie_ratings (just along the akismet directory)

3. Activate the plugin by going into your administration panel and selecting
   Plugins from the menu and clicking the Activate button for the WP Movie
   Ratings.

4. Go to the Manage section in the administration panel and see the new Movies
   menu option there (you’ll find the Firefox bookmarklet there too). Rate at
   least one movie (using the bookmarklet or the administration page).

5. Edit your blog template (it’s probably the best to edit the index.php file)
   and put this line there:
   
   wp_movie_ratings_show(6);
   
   The argument 6 is the number of recent movie ratings to show.

6. Go to your blog and see the movie ratings!
